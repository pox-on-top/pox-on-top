# 👋 Hey there, I'm Pox!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for stopping by.  
I'm a developer who loves mixing creativity with code, and I mainly work with **Python, JavaScript, C, and Lua**.  
I enjoy building projects that are fun, practical, and sometimes a little unexpected.

## 💻 About Me
I spend most of my time working on:
- 🤖 **Discord Bots & Applications** – making servers more lively and automated
- 🌐 **Web Development** – from small tools to interactive platforms
- 🎮 **Roblox Game Logic** – scripting gameplay mechanics and features
- ⚙️ **Automation** – because life’s too short to do repetitive stuff manually!

For me, coding is not just work, it's a way to bring ideas into reality. Whether it's automating something boring, building a game system, or creating an engaging app, I just love the process of making things *work*.
